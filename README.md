## About The Project üöÄ

[![Product Screen Shot](https://placehold.co/600x400/cccccc/ffffff?text=App+Screenshot+Here)]([Link to your project URL])

This project provides a futuristic, touch-free way to control your system's master volume. By analyzing the live feed from your webcam, the application identifies your hand and translates the distance between your thumb and index finger into a specific volume level.

A key feature of this implementation is the activation gesture: the volume is only changed when your **pinky finger is down**. This prevents accidental volume changes while you are not actively gesturing.

### Key Features:
* **Real-time Gesture Recognition:** Uses MediaPipe to instantly detect 21 key hand landmarks.
* **Intuitive Volume-Level Selection:** The distance between your thumb and index finger corresponds to a volume level from 0 to 100.
* **Activation Gesture:** Volume is only set when the pinky finger is down, preventing accidental changes. The volume bar turns green to indicate active control.
* **Visual Feedback:** An on-screen volume bar and percentage display provide immediate feedback on the selected volume level.

### Built With

This project is powered by these amazing Python libraries:

* [![Python][Python.org]][Python-url]
* [![OpenCV][OpenCV.org]][OpenCV-url]
* [![MediaPipe][MediaPipe.dev]][MediaPipe-url]
* [![NumPy][NumPy.org]][NumPy-url]
* [![pycaw][pycaw-url]][pycaw-badge]

## Getting Started üèÅ

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7+**
* A **webcam** connected to your computer.
* **Windows Operating System** (due to the `pycaw` library for volume control).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages**
    A `requirements.txt` file should be created with the following content:
    ```txt
    opencv-python
    mediapipe
    numpy
    pycaw
    comtypes
    ```
    Then, run the installation command:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage üìñ

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application with a single command.

1.  **Run the main script:**
    ```sh
    python volm_handcontrol.py
    ```
2.  **A window will appear showing your webcam feed.**
3.  **Control the volume:**
    * Show your hand to the camera.
    * Adjust the distance between your **thumb and index finger** to select a volume level. You will see the on-screen volume bar and percentage change.
    * To **set the volume**, put your **pinky finger down**. The volume bar will turn green, and the system volume will be updated.
    * Lift your pinky finger to deactivate volume setting. The bar will turn red.
4.  **To quit the application, press the 'q' key.**

## How It Works

The application operates as a real-time data processing pipeline for each frame captured from the webcam:

1.  **Capture:** `OpenCV` captures the video frame from the webcam.
2.  **Detect:** `MediaPipe` processes the frame to detect hand landmarks.
3.  **Interpret:** The script calculates the distance between the thumb tip (Landmark 4) and the index fingertip (Landmark 8).
4.  **Map:** `NumPy`'s `interp()` function maps this distance to a volume percentage (0-100) and a corresponding height for the visual volume bar.
5.  **Check Activation:** The script checks if the pinky finger is down.
6.  **Act:** If the activation gesture is present, `pycaw` sets the system's master volume.
7.  **Display:** `OpenCV` draws the volume bar, percentage, and hand landmarks on the frame and displays it to the user.

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

* [ ] Add a gesture for muting/unmuting (e.g., making a fist).
* [ ] Add cross-platform support for macOS (`osascript`) and Linux (`amixer`).
* [ ] Implement volume smoothing to reduce jitter from small hand movements.
* [ ] Create a simple GUI for settings and webcam selection.
* [ ] Package the application into a standalone executable.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name]/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
